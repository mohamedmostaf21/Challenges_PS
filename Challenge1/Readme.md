# Problem Statement:
Given a set of sensor readings, we want to find the minimum and maximum values.
The sensor readings represent some physical quantity (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity) and are stored in a collection (e.g., an array or list).
# Input:
A collection of sensor readings (e.g., {23, 45, 12, 56, 34}).
#Output:
The minimum and maximum values from the collection (e.g., min = 12, max = 56).
# Complexity:
We aim for an O(1) solution, which means constant time complexity.
This is achievable because we donâ€™t need to iterate through the entire collection; we can directly compute the minimum and maximum.
